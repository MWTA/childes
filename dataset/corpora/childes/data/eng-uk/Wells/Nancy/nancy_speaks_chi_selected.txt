All the muck you messy fir.
Shall i tip the rubbish.
Shall i take it out.
You clap handy clap clap.
Run all the way home.
Shall i turn the ellie back on.
She's going to see dolly.
All the way home all the way home.
Put that on or you'll get.
Where's the other one to.
Nancy lepton not that way na.
My birthday card that yours.
Clap your hands clap your hands.
And do it up like that.
All those all those hot.
All the way home with me.
Shall i turn it back on.

Shall i tip it out.
When you've cooked my din you'll cook yours.
I've got an elastic band.
That jumper's too hot isn't it.
You got holes in them.
He buys my frogs don't he.
Put them down back again.
That's a ticket it is.
