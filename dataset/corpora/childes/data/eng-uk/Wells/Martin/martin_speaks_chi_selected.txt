I saw it crawl down there.
One two three four five.
Can i have a cheese.
Empty dumpy sat on a wall.
And come on back to here.
Up the hill in a minute.
Don't go on that one.
Ah that's got my battery in.
Try to get on madam chalet.
Empty dumpy sat on the wall.
Er come up another day.
Put me on my swing.
Mummies can i go over there.
You can't have any more.
To draw on the paper now.
You threw it on my womble book.
I saw one down there.
