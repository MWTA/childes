You get in there in the summer.
That and that and that they got cuffs.
That was chipped off on that end off.
Get in he in the summer out the back.

Be nice in the summer.
You go and see nick.

Read my book on my own.
Got iron on that tin look.

Mummie's got in that bottle there.
You do it will you.
Hit me in the ear then.
