There's some more stones for you to get the spiders out.
Why should the gardener do it.
Whichever way you want to blow it.
Or one of the yellow ones or something like that.
Can i carry one for you.
Yes i could do eh.
Mummies i'm just asking if i can get it out with this towel.
Then when it was too big.
Well i want to put them back in.
Then they're going to have a drink.
And now i'm rubbing it down.
You blow whichever way you want to blow it anyway.
Do you another bit to crumble it up.
There's a fly on here.
Well how can that get out mummy.

On top of on that.
Somebody's stuck purple in that.
So i don't want that rest.
Why do you think it's a bit smeary.
This is the bit where they go to a dog.
There's a beetle in my sand.
What do you think that is.
Well that was thirteen though.
But i shouldn't stir it should i.
Mine's much louder isn't it.
Well just now some of that polish waved in my eye.

This is going to be a necklace with all those things.
Because i'm going to have a bit of it before.
Yours goes into nice nasty red color.
After that we will go and get it to have for each.
Well that is to make it so nice.
Like it's supposed to be.
Why did you put your hand on your eye.
Wall empty dumpy had a great fall.
It squeezed the poorly bit out.
And that one to make it go on.
This is a grass cutter for you.
It fits the lorry of my.
Then a bit of the big one.

Wonder where the top was for that fuel thing.
Do you see that biscuit.
And then a bit of the little one.
Why couldn't i do one of these.
And their mothers' will be after them.
Or they'll be slapped by their mother.
It goes into red color.
They shouldn't have done should they.
We can tip it out cans't we.
It's their own fault for doing it.
They are all different color cakes aren't they.

Quick before the crawly things go on.
Watch so that you don't break the cakes.
How about doing my cow.
Coo he's growing and coughing.
Why are you taking those out.
The broken bits are still nice.
Well i don't crumble it up.
That one is to make it go off.
And then you're going to have a bit of the little one.
Have to see if i can get it out with this.
When it's time to get off we press that one to make it go off.
And i'll drive the screws in here.

The roller and the cutter.
